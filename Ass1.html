      Batman is a fictional comic character created by artist Bob Kane and
      writer Bill finger.<br />
      Batman first appeared in DC comics in the year 1939 and soon become
      popular. Batman[a] is a superhero who appears in American comic books
      published by DC Comics. Batman was created by artist Bob Kane and writer
      Bill Finger, and debuted in the 27th issue of the comic book Detective
      Comics on March 30, 1939. In the DC Universe continuity, Batman is the
      alias of Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American playboy, philanthropist, and
      industrialist who resides in Gotham City. Batman's origin story features
      him swearing vengeance against criminals after witnessing the murder of
      his parents Thomas and Martha; he trains himself physically and
      intellectually, crafts a bat-inspired persona, and monitors the Gotham
      streets at night. Kane, Finger, and other creators accompanied Batman with
      supporting characters, including his sidekick Robin; allies Alfred
      Pennyworth, James Gordon, and Catwoman; and foes such as the Penguin, the
      Riddler, Two-Face, and his archenemy, the Joker. Kane conceived Batman in
      early 1939 to capitalize on the popularity of DC's Superman; although Kane
      frequently claimed sole creation credit, Finger substantially developed
      the concept from a generic superhero into something more bat-like. The
      character received his own spin-off publication, Batman, in 1940. Batman
      was originally introduced as a ruthless vigilante who frequently killed or
      maimed criminals, but evolved into a character with a stringent moral code
      and strong sense of justice. Unlike most superheroes, Batman does not
      possess any superpowers, instead relying on his intellect, fighting
      skills, and wealth. The 1960s Batman television series used a camp
      aesthetic, which continued to be associated with the character for years
      after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to
      his darker roots in the 1970s and 1980s, culminating with the 1986
      miniseries The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller.

        Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American
        industrialist who resides just outside of Gotham City. As a child, Bruce
        witnessed the murder of his parents, Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne,
        which ultimately led him to craft the Batman persona and seek vengeance
        against criminals. Wayne averts suspicion by acting the part of a
        superficial playboy idly living off his family's fortune, which was
        amassed through investment in real estate before the city became a
        bustling metropolis, and the profits of Wayne Enterprises, his inherited
        conglomerate.Bruce Wayne resides just outside of Gotham City in Wayne
        Manor. He supports philanthropic causes through his nonprofit Wayne
        Foundation, but is more widely known as a celebrity socialite. In
        public, he appears frequently in the company of high-status women, which
        encourages tabloid gossip. Although Bruce Wayne leads an active romantic
        life, crime-fighting accounts for most of his time
